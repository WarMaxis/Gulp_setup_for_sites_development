## How to start?
1. First, create new JS entry file ```main.js```, in main ```/src/js/``` directory.

2. _Optionally you can create ```tinypng_api_key.txt``` text file in ```/dependencies/``` directory with your __[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) API key__._

3. _Optionally you can create ```ftp_accesses.json``` JSON file in ```/dependencies/``` directory with your __FTP passes__._  
_JSON structure:_  
```json
{
    "host": "yourhost.net",
    "user": "example",
    "password": "verystrongpassword123",
    "hostDirectory": "yourdirectory/anotherdirectory/"
}
```

4. Install dependencies (you can use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) also)
```bash
$ npm install
```

5. Run Gulp default tasks or one task
```bash
$ gulp
```
